I'm a recent graduate of Duke University, where I studied psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. I am interested in applying a background in cognition to tackle interdisciplinary challenges from an ecologically valid, evidence-based, and empirically-informed perspective on brain and behavior.

My current research interests include the psychology and cognitive neuroscience of morality, dehumanization, religiosity, causation, free will, and normative ethics. I have previously also studied topics in lower-level cognitive processing such as mind wandering, memory, creativity, and imagination.

I have experience in a wide range of software and coding languages, and am an avid advocate of robust, open science research practices. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a scientist as I pursue a career in academia :)
