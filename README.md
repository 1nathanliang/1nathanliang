## ʙᴀᴄᴋɢʀᴏᴜɴᴅ 🎓

I am a `🧸` first-year Ph.D. student in the [*Applied Moral Psychology Lab*][0] in the Department of Psychology at Cornell.

From 2022–2023, I was employed as a **field experiment project manager** in the `🦅` [*Morality Lab*][1] in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience and Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society with [Dr. Liane Young][2] and [Dr. Gregg R. Sparkman][3] at Boston College. I also served as research coordinator for the [*Applied Cooperation Initiative*][4] with [Dr. David Rand][5] and [Dr. Erez Yoeli][6] at the MiT Sloan School of Management. In brief, my job wass to oversee behavioral studies that validate psychological interventions for good (e.g., supporting public health, increasing charitable donation, or promoting sustainable life practices) in the "real world."

Previously, I was a **lab manager** + **research specialist** in the `🐅` [*Princeton Social Neuroscience Lab*][7] working across the Princeton Neuroscience Institute and Department of Psychology with [Dr. Diana I. Tamir][8] at Princeton. There, I mostly contributed to analyses of behavioral data evincing interventions for empathy and interpersonal social connection.

I graduated early (during the COVID-19 pandemic) in 2020 with a B.S. in psychology and minor in philosophy from Duke University where I was a research assistant in the the [*Mind at Large Lab*][9] with [Dr. Paul Seli][10] and postgraduate research fellow in the [*Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab*][11] and [*Moral Attitudes and Decision-Making Lab*][12] under the supervision of [Dr. Felipe De Brigard][13], and [Dr. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong][14], respectively.

## ʀᴇsᴇᴀʀᴄʜ 🔬

I'm fascinated by open questions in moral psychology (social norms and learning) and am interested in applying computational methods to try to answer them. I also maintain a keen interest in the experimental philosophy of religion.

For a running list of my publications, please reference my [Google Scholar profile][15]. You can find full-text .pdf files of all my peer-reviewed journal articles directly from my website [repo][16]. If you would like to read any of my work in *progress*, please feel free to reach out to me directly, and I'll happily provide you with a copy.

## sᴋɪʟʟs 🧑🏻‍💻

I work almost exclusively in `python` (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `huggingface`) and `r` (`tidyverse`, `lme4`, and `psych`) to clean and analyze behavioral data, but I've also used `javascript` (i.e., `jquery`, `react`) here and there in shorter, aggressive bursts. I'm currently looking to start using `d3.js` more actively to visualize data for the web!

As a behavioral science researcher, I enjoy an incredibly eclectic range of day-to-day work: `🎨` experimental design, `🤖` web scraping and automation, `⌨️` NLP, `🧮` ML, `📉` statistical analysis, `📊` data visualization, and `📜` manuscript preparation, to name but a *few*! I've also conducted `🧠` brain scans using `🧲` fMRI and preprocessed data via `🌐` high performance computing.

## ғᴜɴ sᴛᴜғғ 🫠

Outside of work, the love of my life will always be `⚽️` soccer. I also enjoy vacillating between thought-provoking and emotionally resonant `🎬` sci-fi films and low-brow action flicks, `🏃` working out, and experimenting with `🎧` music production.
