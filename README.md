## ʙᴀᴄᴋɢʀᴏᴜɴᴅ 🎓

I'm a **lab manager** + **research specialist** in the 🐅 [*Princeton Social Neuroscience Lab*][1] working at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute][2] and [Department of Psychology][3] with [Dr. Diana I. Tamir][4] at Princeton University.

I'll be starting as a moral psychology field experiment coordinator in the 🦅 [*Morality Lab*][13] as well as the Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society with [Dr. Liane Young][14] and [Dr. Gregg R. Sparkman][15] at Boston College in the summer of 2022.

Previously, I completed my B.S. in psychology and minor in philosophy at Duke University where I worked as a research assistant in the the [*Mind at Large Lab*][6] and a postgraduate research fellow in the [*Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab*][5] and the [*Moral Attitudes and Decision-Making Lab*][7] under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Seli][9], [Dr. Felipe De Brigard][8], and [Dr. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong][10], respectively.

I'm fascinated by open questions in moral psychology (norms, justice, and emotions) and am currently applying computational methods to study social cognition. I also maintain a keen interest in the experimental philosophy of religion.

## sᴋɪʟʟs 🧑🏻‍💻

I work almost exclusively in [tag:python] (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `huggingface`) and `r` (`tidyverse`) to clean and analyze behavioral data, but I've also used `javascript` (i.e., `jQuery`, `React`) here and there. I'm currently looking to start using and `d3.js` more actively!

As a psychology and neuroscience researcher, my day-to-day work involves `🎨` study design, `📉` statistical analysis, `📊` data visualization, and `📜` manuscript preparation. I also conduct `🧠` brain scans using `🧲` fMRI and data preprocessing via `🌐` high performance computing.
