## ʙᴀᴄᴋɢʀᴏᴜɴᴅ 🎓

Starting in the summer of 2022, I've been working as a **moral psychology field experiment research coordinator** in the 🦅 [*Morality Lab*][13] in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience as well as the newly established Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society with [Dr. Liane Young][14] and [Dr. Gregg R. Sparkman][16] at Boston College.

Previously, I was a **lab manager** + **research specialist** in the 🐅 [*Princeton Social Neuroscience Lab*][1] working jointly in the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute][2] and [Department of Psychology][3] with [Dr. Diana I. Tamir][4] at Princeton University.

I graduated early in 2020 with a B.S. in psychology and minor in philosophy from Duke University where I worked as a research assistant in the the [*Mind at Large Lab*][6] with [Dr. Paul Seli][9] and as a postgraduate research fellow in the [*Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab*][5] and the [*Moral Attitudes and Decision-Making Lab*][7] under the supervision of [Dr. Felipe De Brigard][8], and [Dr. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong][10], respectively.

## ʀᴇsᴇᴀʀᴄʜ 🔬

I'm fascinated by open questions in moral psychology (social norms, justice, and empathy) and am interested in applying computational methods to try to answer them. I also maintain a keen interest in the experimental philosophy of religion.

For a running list of my publications, please reference my [Google Scholar profile][15]. If you do not have access but would like to read any of my work in full, please feel free to reach out to me directly, and I'll happily provide you with a full-text copy of the article.

## sᴋɪʟʟs 🧑🏻‍💻

I work almost exclusively in `python` (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `huggingface`) and `r` (`tidyverse`, `lme4`, and ``) to clean and analyze behavioral data, but I've also used `javascript` (i.e., `jQuery`, `React`) here and there. I'm currently looking to start using `d3.js` more actively!

As a psychology and neuroscience researcher, my day-to-day work involves `🎨` study design, `📉` statistical analysis, `📊` data visualization, and `📜` manuscript preparation. I also conduct `🧠` brain scans using `🧲` fMRI and data preprocessing via `🌐` high performance computing. As a project manager, I have also been responsible for administrative work including `💸` finance reports, `🏘️` community-building event organization, and `🗂️` database management.

## ғᴜɴ sᴛᴜғғ 🫠

Outside of work, the love of my life will always be `⚽️` soccer. I also enjoy watching thought-provoking and emotionally resonant `🎬` sci-fi films, `🏃🏻` working out, and experimenting with `🎧` music production.
