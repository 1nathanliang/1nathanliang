## ʙᴀᴄᴋɢʀᴏᴜɴᴅ 🎓

Starting in the summer of 2022, I've been working as a **moral psychology field experiment research coordinator** in the 🦅 [*Morality Lab*][13] as well as the Schiller Institute for Integrated Science and Society with [Dr. Liane Young][14] and [Dr. Gregg R. Sparkman][15] at Boston College.

Previously, I was a **lab manager** + **research specialist** in the 🐅 [*Princeton Social Neuroscience Lab*][1] working at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute][2] and [Department of Psychology][3] with [Dr. Diana I. Tamir][4] at Princeton University.

I graduated early in 2020 with a B.S. in psychology and minor in philosophy from Duke University where I worked as a research assistant in the the [*Mind at Large Lab*][6] with [Dr. Paul Seli][9] and as a postgraduate research fellow in the [*Imagination and Modal Cognition Lab*][5] and the [*Moral Attitudes and Decision-Making Lab*][7] under the supervision of [Dr. Felipe De Brigard][8], and [Dr. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong][10], respectively.

I'm fascinated by open questions in moral psychology (social norms, justice, and empathy) and am interested in applying computational methods to try to answer them. I also maintain a keen interest in the experimental philosophy of religion.

## sᴋɪʟʟs 🧑🏻‍💻

I work almost exclusively in `python` (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `huggingface`) and `r` (`tidyverse`) to clean and analyze behavioral data, but I've also used `javascript` (i.e., `jQuery`, `React`) here and there. I'm currently looking to start using and `d3.js` more actively!

As a psychology and neuroscience researcher, my day-to-day work involves `🎨` study design, `📉` statistical analysis, `📊` data visualization, and `📜` manuscript preparation. I also conduct `🧠` brain scans using `🧲` fMRI and data preprocessing via `🌐` high performance computing. As a project manager, I have also been responsible for administrative work including `💸` finance reports, `🏘️` community-building event organization, and `🗂️` database management.
